An effective Red Team is comprised of a team of individuals who can contribute to the overall success. Diversity is crucial, but the team as a whole must be comprised of the core operator traits. A team can be even more successful when multiple team members contribute in various areas. In addition to the Red Team itself, successful execution of an engagement requires the involvement of numerous roles and groups.
