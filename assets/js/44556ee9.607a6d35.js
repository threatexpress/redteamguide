Get In, Stay In, and Act. The sequence of activities in this approach involves open source intelligence (OSINT) collection, enumeration, exploitation, and attack. Information gathered during OSINT collection is used in conjunction with passive and active enumeration. Enumeration information typically yields details about specific hardware, services, and software running on remote machines. The next phase involves analyzing all accumulated information to identify potential attack vectors.
