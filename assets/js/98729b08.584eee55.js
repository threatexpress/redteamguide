Built on the fundamentals of penetration testing, Red Teaming uses a comprehensive approach to gain insight into an organization\u2019s overall security to test its ability to detect, respond to, and recover from an attack. When properly conducted, Red Team activities significantly improve an organization\u2019s security controls, help hone defensive capabilities, and measure the effectiveness of security operations."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The Red Team concept requires a different approach from typical security testing and relies heavily on well-defined TTPs, which are critical to successfully emulating a realistic threat or adversary. Red Team results exceed a typical list of penetration test vulnerabilities, provide a deeper understanding of how an organization would perform against an actual threat, and identify where security strengths and weaknesses exist. Whether you support a defensive or offensive role in security, understanding how Red Teams can be used to improve security is extremely valuable. Organizations spend a great deal of time and money on the security of their systems, and it is critical to have professionals who can effectively and efficiently operate them. This book will provide you with the skills to manage and operate a Red Team, conduct Red Team engagements, and understand the role of a Red Team and its importance in security testing."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},8938:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=o.p+"assets/files/red_team_development_and_operations_toc-7823d1b25b6ff45db23d634a5055d5fa.pdf"}}]);
